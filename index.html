            <h3>Ms Dhoni</h3>
            <p>An everyday man who went on to be popularly known as the ‘Captain Cool’
                is none other than our very own Indian Men’s (ODI & T20Is) Cricket Team
                Captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni or simply known as Dhoni.

                His journey marks from being a simple small town boy to the man who led a
                team to victory in the T-20 World Cup.
                <h3>Inspirational Start</h3>
                <p>
                    There was once a time when the Indian Cricket Team was simply 
                    filled with the city kids. Due to excellent infrastructure and 
                    good scope for the game in cities, many small town boys would not
                     succeed defeating them in the Ranji Trophy. But this man proved 
                     it all wrong. MSD had seen a dream, which many feared to see.
                </p>
                <h3> MS dhoni-cool</h3>
                <p>
                    Hailing from a very small town of Ranchi, Dhoni dared to dream and
                    with courage and guts make that dream a reality. Since a very young
                    age, he idolized Sachin Tendulkar who is known as the God of Cricket
                    and Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan. He started his career as a 
                    Ticket Collector in Indian Railways. His hard work and never-give-up
                    spirit finally landed him in International Cricket in 2003.
                </p>
                <h3>Becoming a Sensation and Captaincy</h3>
                <p>
                    Dhoni was not only known for his cricket but was also very popular for 
                    his lengthy wavy hair style. In fact, it had then become a trend that
                    every boy in the country now wanted to adorn the “Dhoni Hairstyle”.
                    <p>Dhoni started making rounds for his cool attitude – something we all most 
                        aspire to emulate. We would find him with a smile even in the toughest of
                        games. This calm attitude of his landed him as the Captain of the team. He
                        had not only made his dream of playing alongside his idol Sachin a reality
                        but had become his captain.

            <h3>Ms Dhoni</h3>
            <p>Some of his qualities which makes people go crazy are as follows-
                <h3> 1) Handling Success -</h3>
                <p>
                    People who gain success in their early stage of career often lose their balance.
                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni who got success in his early stage of career but he was, and
                    still is humble and modest. He does not get over- emotional in victory, or in 
                    defeat. He knows how to handle success.
                </p>
                <h3> 2) Trust your instinct -</h3>

                <p>
                    I have never seen a better observer of the game than MS Dhoni. Dhoni always
                    follow his instincts and make decision by his gut feelings. 
                </p>
                <h3> 3) Competitor respect -</h3>
                <p>
                    In sport or in any other field , you know you have achieved a milestone when your
                    opponents take you seriously and allow themselves to show a degree of respect to
                    you. <p>Dhoni has made that happen by his consistent, calm behavior. You will never
                     find Dhoni as a part of sledging on the field.</p>
                </p>
                <h3> 4) Lead from the front -</h3>
                <p>
                    On numerous occasions, Mahi single handedly won matches for India.
                    He has been amongst the ICC top 10 batsmen in ODIs for past any 
                    years and is a tremendous and an extra-ordinary finisher of the 
                    game. A team leader should be able to lead by example especially 
                    when the team needs the most. No one can forget the inning played
                    by MSD in 2011 World Cup Final at Wankhede, Mumbai. He rose up to
                    the occasion and played decisive role in the victory.

                </p>
                <h3> 5) His leadership skills -</h3>
                <p>
                    He is the best captain India has ever seen. And after leaving 
                    captaincy even , he is the virtual on-field captain . He is often 
                    seen advicing Virat and other players towards their game. This shows
                    his commitment towards his team.
